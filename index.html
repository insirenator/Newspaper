				<h2 class="article-title">Enigma and Conspiracy</h2>
				<p class="content">The beginnings, both of earth and of man, are a complete mystery. The theories concerning our beginnings that we have been presented with, by both Academics,who talk of evolution and gradualism; and by Theologians who claim creation, are each fraught with a myriad of inconsistencies and contradictions. In reality, the true histories of both man and of our planet are still an enormous riddle. It would seem that all anthropological, archeological and now even genetic evidence says that modern man simply does not belong here. <span class="hidden-content hide" >We have, in some ways, gained some insight into the very first stages of our Solar System and our home planet. How it was first formed from the gases, elements and primordial stuff of the universe, gradually cooling into a solid sphere and how the elements then reacted and combined until somehow at last, the spark of life was born; but from then on, it becomes a little hazy. Embracing evolution, scholars have taught us that all life on earth first came from the sea, gradually finding limbs and crawling its way onto land where it slowly evolved to form new creatures, and eventually birds, animals and all other life. We are taught that in ancient times, well before the dawn of man, strange prehistoric beasts of huge proportions ruled the earth, enormous cold blooded reptilian creatures, which we have named Dinosaur, meaning: “Terrible Lizard.” It is believed they first appeared around 193 million years ago and reigned supreme until most were wiped out some 65 million years ago in the shattering impact of a meteorite or comet fragment in the vicinity of the Gulf of Mexico.</span></p>

				<h2 class="article-title">Riddles from the Past</h2>
				<p class="content">It all started for me when I was a young child and I saw a picture of the Great Pyramid. I was told right then that no-one really knew how it was done and in that moment I was hooked on our mysterious past. From that moment, all interest in comic books was gone and for hours I would pore over my mother’s encyclopedias. I couldn’t understand much of the text, but the pictures of Dinosaurs and ancient and mysterious megalithic structures absorbed me totally. <span class="hidden-content hide" >From that moment, all interest in comic books was gone and for hours I would pore over my mother’s encyclopedias. I couldn’t understand much of the text, but the pictures of Dinosaurs and ancient and mysterious megalithic structures absorbed me totally. Where do they come from I wondered? Does mankind really have an unknown history that has been lost or forgotten? Could there really have been an advanced civilization in far ancient times, before our recorded history? The questions and debates on the issue have raged for years. When asked, most scholars will tell you that it’s a nice idea, but fanciful at best and there is really no hard evidence to show that such a civilization ever really existed. However, many others will argue that there is actually a significant body of evidence that does exist that simply cannot be explained away. So what are the realities? What kind of evidence are we talking about? Just a bunch of weird cave paintings and esoteric theories by strange people, or is there something more tangible?</span></p>
